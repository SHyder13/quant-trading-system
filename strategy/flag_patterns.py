#     def identify_bull_flag(self, historical_data):
#         """
#         Identifies a bull flag pattern based on institutional criteria.

#         A high-quality bull flag consists of:
#         1.  **The Flagpole**: A sharp, high-volume, upward price move (an 'explosive' or 'impulse' leg).
#             - Look for several consecutive large-body green candles.
#             - Volume should be significantly above average during this move.
#         2.  **The Flag**: A period of orderly, downward-sloping consolidation on low volume.
#             - Price action should be contained within a tight, parallel channel (a gentle pullback).
#             - Volume should dry up significantly during this consolidation, indicating a lack of selling pressure.
#         3.  **The Breakout**: A high-volume breakout above the upper trendline of the consolidation channel.
#             - The breakout candle should be a strong, large-body green candle.
#             - Volume should spike, confirming conviction from buyers.

#         Returns: A dictionary with pattern details if a valid flag is found, otherwise None.

#         # Implementation would involve iterating through candles to find these three components in sequence.

#     def identify_bear_flag(self, historical_data):
#         """
#         Identifies a bear flag pattern based on institutional criteria.

#         A high-quality bear flag consists of:
#         1.  **The Flagpole**: A sharp, high-volume, downward price move (an 'impulse' leg down).
#             - Look for several consecutive large-body red candles.
#             - Volume should be significantly above average.
#         2.  **The Flag**: A period of orderly, upward-sloping consolidation on low volume (a weak rally).
#             - Price action should be contained within a tight, parallel channel.
#             - Volume should be noticeably lower than during the flagpole, indicating a lack of buying interest.
#         3.  **The Breakout**: A high-volume breakdown below the lower trendline of the consolidation channel.
#             - The breakdown candle should be a strong, large-body red candle.
#             - Volume should spike, confirming aggressive selling.

#         Returns: A dictionary with pattern details if a valid flag is found, otherwise None.
